## Ducks Pattern

### File Structure
```
src/
└── store/
    ├── index.js
    ├── userSlice.js
    └── postsSlice.js
```

### Key Components
1. **index.js**: 
   - Imports: Redux functions, thunk, slice reducers
   - Purpose: Combines reducers, creates store
   - Exports: Configured store

2. **[feature]Slice.js** (e.g., userSlice.js):
   - Contains: Action types, action creators, thunks, reducer
   - Exports: Reducer (default), action creators, thunks (named)

## Traditional Pattern

### File Structure
```
src/
└── store/
    ├── index.js
    ├── reducers/
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── userReducer.js
    │   └── postsReducer.js
    └── actions/
        ├── userActions.js
        └── postsActions.js
```

### Key Components
1. **store/index.js**: 
   - Imports: Redux functions, thunk, root reducer
   - Purpose: Creates store with middleware
   - Exports: Configured store

2. **reducers/index.js**:
   - Purpose: Combines individual reducers
   - Exports: Root reducer

3. **reducers/[feature]Reducer.js**:
   - Contains: Initial state, reducer function
   - Exports: Reducer function

4. **actions/[feature]Actions.js**:
   - Contains: Action types, action creators, thunks
   - Exports: Action creators, thunks

You're right to question that. Let me clarify the imports for the traditional pattern, as they differ across files:

## Redux Traditional Pattern: File-Specific Imports

1. **store/index.js**:
   ```javascript
   import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
   import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
   import rootReducer from './reducers';
   ```

2. **reducers/index.js**:
   ```javascript
   import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
   import userReducer from './userReducer';
   import postsReducer from './postsReducer';
   ```

3. **reducers/[feature]Reducer.js** (e.g., userReducer.js):
   ```javascript
   // Often no imports needed, unless using action types from action file
   import { SET_USER, LOGOUT } from '../actions/userActions';
   ```

4. **actions/[feature]Actions.js** (e.g., userActions.js):
   ```javascript
   // Often no imports needed for basic setup
   // For async actions:
   import thunk from 'redux-thunk'; // if not applied globally
   ```

Key Points:
- The main Redux imports are typically only in store/index.js
- Reducer files often don't need imports unless referencing action types
- Action files might not need imports for basic setups
- Thunk is usually imported and applied in store/index.js, not in individual files

Remember: These are typical setups, but actual imports may vary based on your specific implementation and needs.

## Key Differences
1. Ducks: All feature logic in one file
2. Traditional: Separates actions and reducers
3. Ducks: Fewer, larger files
4. Traditional: More, focused files

## Choosing an Approach
- Ducks: Good for smaller projects, quicker setup
- Traditional: Better for large projects, clear separation of concerns

Remember: Consistency is key! Choose the pattern that best fits your project's needs and stick with it throughout your application.
