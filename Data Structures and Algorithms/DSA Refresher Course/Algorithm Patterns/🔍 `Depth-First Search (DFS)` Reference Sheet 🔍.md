## Definition üìù
Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Starting from a selected node, DFS explores as deeply as possible before stepping back and exploring other paths. It uses a stack data structure (either explicitly or through recursion) to keep track of nodes to visit next.

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time Complexity | O(V + E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V) |

Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

## Core Operations üîç
- **Visit**: Process the current node
- **Mark as visited**: Track nodes already explored
- **Push neighbors**: Add unvisited adjacent nodes to the stack
- **Backtrack**: Return to previous node when current path is fully explored

## Implementation üíª

### Recursive Implementation
```python
def dfs_recursive(graph, node, visited=None):
    # Initialize visited set on first call
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    
    # Mark current node as visited
    visited.add(node)
    print(f"Visiting node {node}")
    
    # Explore all adjacent unvisited nodes
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)
    
    return visited
```

### Iterative Implementation (using explicit stack)
```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start_node):
    # Initialize visited set and stack
    visited = set()
    stack = [start_node]
    
    while stack:
        # Pop the top node from stack
        node = stack.pop()
        
        # Skip if already visited
        if node in visited:
            continue
        
        # Mark as visited and process
        visited.add(node)
        print(f"Visiting node {node}")
        
        # Add unvisited neighbors to stack
        # (reversed to maintain same order as recursive version)
        for neighbor in reversed(graph[node]):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                stack.append(neighbor)
    
    return visited
```

## Common Applications üöÄ

### 1. Tree Traversals
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

# Pre-order traversal (Root ‚Üí Left ‚Üí Right)
def preorder(root):
    if not root:
        return
    print(root.val)  # Visit root
    preorder(root.left)  # Visit left subtree
    preorder(root.right)  # Visit right subtree

# In-order traversal (Left ‚Üí Root ‚Üí Right)
def inorder(root):
    if not root:
        return
    inorder(root.left)  # Visit left subtree
    print(root.val)  # Visit root
    inorder(root.right)  # Visit right subtree

# Post-order traversal (Left ‚Üí Right ‚Üí Root)
def postorder(root):
    if not root:
        return
    postorder(root.left)  # Visit left subtree
    postorder(root.right)  # Visit right subtree
    print(root.val)  # Visit root
```

### 2. Path Finding
```python
def dfs_path(graph, start, end, path=None):
    if path is None:
        path = []
    
    # Add current node to path
    path = path + [start]
    
    # If reached destination
    if start == end:
        return path
    
    # Explore all neighbors
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in path:  # Avoid cycles
            new_path = dfs_path(graph, neighbor, end, path)
            if new_path:
                return new_path
    
    # No path found
    return None
```

### 3. Connected Components
```python
def find_connected_components(graph):
    visited = set()
    components = []
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            # Start a new component
            component = set()
            dfs_component(graph, node, visited, component)
            components.append(component)
    
    return components

def dfs_component(graph, node, visited, component):
    visited.add(node)
    component.add(node)
    
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_component(graph, neighbor, visited, component)
```

### 4. Cycle Detection
```python
def has_cycle(graph):
    visited = set()
    rec_stack = set()  # Keep track of nodes in current recursion stack
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            if is_cyclic(graph, node, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
    
    return False

def is_cyclic(graph, node, visited, rec_stack):
    visited.add(node)
    rec_stack.add(node)
    
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        # If not visited and has cycle in subtree
        if neighbor not in visited:
            if is_cyclic(graph, neighbor, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        # If the neighbor is in recursion stack, cycle exists
        elif neighbor in rec_stack:
            return True
    
    # Remove node from recursion stack
    rec_stack.remove(node)
    return False
```

## Visualization üìä
```
Graph:          DFS traversal (starting from A):
    A           
   / \          A ‚Üí B ‚Üí D ‚Üí E ‚Üí C
  B   C         
 / \            Stack progression:
D   E           [A] ‚Üí [B, C] ‚Üí [D, E, C] ‚Üí [E, C] ‚Üí [C] ‚Üí []
```

## Variations and Optimizations üîÑ
- **Iterative Deepening DFS**: Combines benefits of BFS and DFS by gradually increasing depth limit
- **Bidirectional DFS**: Searches from both start and end nodes to find path faster
- **DFS with pruning**: Skips branches that can't lead to a solution
- **Informed DFS**: Uses heuristics to prioritize more promising paths

## Advantages and Disadvantages ‚öñÔ∏è

### Advantages ‚úÖ
- Uses less memory than BFS for deep graphs
- Naturally suited for problems like topological sorting and maze generation
- Simpler implementation with recursion
- Can find solutions far from the root quickly
- Well-suited for exploring all possible paths

### Disadvantages ‚ùå
- May get stuck in very deep or infinite paths
- Does not guarantee shortest path
- Can be inefficient for finding nodes close to starting point
- Recursive implementation may cause stack overflow for very deep graphs
- Not optimal for finding all nodes at a given distance

## Real-world Applications üåê
