## Definition üìù
Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm that breaks down a problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems of the same type, solves these subproblems independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem. This approach is fundamental in computer science and forms the basis for many efficient algorithms.

The paradigm consists of three main steps:
1. **Divide**: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
2. **Conquer**: Solve the subproblems recursively
3. **Combine**: Merge the solutions of subproblems to create a solution to the original problem

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
The time complexity of divide and conquer algorithms is typically analyzed using the **Master Theorem**:

If T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where:
- a ‚â• 1 (number of subproblems)
- b > 1 (factor by which problem size is reduced)
- f(n) is the cost of dividing and combining

Then:
- If f(n) = O(n^c) where c < log_b(a), then T(n) = Œò(n^(log_b(a)))
- If f(n) = Œò(n^c) where c = log_b(a), then T(n) = Œò(n^c log n)
- If f(n) = Œ©(n^c) where c > log_b(a), then T(n) = Œò(f(n))

## Core Operations üîç
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down a problem into smaller instances
- **Base Case Handling**: Solving trivially small problems directly
- **Recursive Solving**: Applying the same algorithm to subproblems
- **Solution Combination**: Merging subsolutions into a complete solution
- **Recursive Tree Analysis**: Understanding the recursive call structure

## Common Divide and Conquer Algorithms üíª

### 1. Merge Sort
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    # Base case
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    # Divide
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    
    # Combine (Merge)
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    
    # Combine the two sorted arrays
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Add remaining elements
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n) - Divides in half (log n levels) with linear merging (n)

### 2. Quick Sort
```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    # Choose pivot (here: first element)
    pivot = arr[0]
    
    # Divide
    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]
    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]
    
    # Conquer and Combine
    return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)
```
**Time Complexity**: 
- Average: O(n log n)
- Worst: O(n¬≤) when poorly partitioned

### 3. Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(arr, target, low=0, high=None):
    if high is None:
        high = len(arr) - 1
    
    # Base case: element not found
    if low > high:
        return -1
    
    # Divide
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    
    # Conquer
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        return binary_search(arr, target, low, mid-1)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, target, mid+1, high)
```
**Time Complexity**: O(log n)

### 4. Karatsuba Multiplication
```python
def karatsuba(x, y):
    # Base case for recursion
    if x < 10 or y < 10:
        return x * y
    
    # Calculate size of numbers
    n = max(len(str(x)), len(str(y)))
    m = n // 2
    
    # Split the numbers
    power = 10**m
    a, b = x // power, x % power
    c, d = y // power, y % power
    
    # Recursive steps
    ac = karatsuba(a, c)
    bd = karatsuba(b, d)
    abcd = karatsuba(a+b, c+d) - ac - bd
    
    # Combine results
    return ac * (10**(2*m)) + abcd * (10**m) + bd
```
**Time Complexity**: O(n^log‚ÇÇ(3)) ‚âà O(n^1.585)

### 5. Closest Pair of Points
```python
def closest_pair(points):
    # Sort points by x-coordinate
    points_sorted_by_x = sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[0])
    
    # Recursive function to find closest pair
    def closest_pair_recursive(points_by_x):
        n = len(points_by_x)
        
        # Base cases
        if n <= 3:
            return brute_force_closest(points_by_x)
        
        # Divide
        mid = n // 2
        mid_point = points_by_x[mid]
        left_half = points_by_x[:mid]
        right_half = points_by_x[mid:]
        
        # Conquer
        delta_left = closest_pair_recursive(left_half)
        delta_right = closest_pair_recursive(right_half)
        delta = min(delta_left, delta_right)
        
        # Combine: Check points close to the dividing line
        strip = [p for p in points_by_x if abs(p[0] - mid_point[0]) < delta]
        strip.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])  # Sort by y-coordinate
        
        # Check points in the strip
        for i in range(len(strip)):
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(strip) and strip[j][1] - strip[i][1] < delta:
                dist = distance(strip[i], strip[j])
                if dist < delta:
                    delta = dist
                j += 1
                
        return delta
    
    return closest_pair_recursive(points_sorted_by_x)

def distance(p1, p2):
    return ((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)**0.5

def brute_force_closest(points):
    n = len(points)
    min_dist = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            dist = distance(points[i], points[j])
            min_dist = min(min_dist, dist)
    return min_dist
```
**Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
