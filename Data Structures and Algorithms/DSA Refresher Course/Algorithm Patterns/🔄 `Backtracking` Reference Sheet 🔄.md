## Definition üìù
Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that builds a solution incrementally, abandoning a path as soon as it determines that the path cannot lead to a valid solution ("backtracking") and then trying another path. It's essentially a refined brute force approach that prunes the search space by avoiding paths that cannot lead to a valid solution.

Backtracking is characterized by:
- Incremental solution building
- Constraint checking at each step
- Undoing choices that lead to dead ends
- Depth-first search exploration of possibilities

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
| Aspect | Complexity | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Time   | O(b^d)     | Where b is the branching factor and d is the maximum depth |
| Space  | O(d)       | For the recursion stack where d is the maximum depth |

The exact complexity varies widely depending on the specific problem and how effectively the solution prunes invalid paths.

## Core Operations üîç
```
1. Choose: Select a candidate for the solution
2. Constraint Check: Verify if the candidate can lead to a valid solution
3. Explore: If valid, recursively attempt to build the rest of the solution
4. Unchoose (Backtrack): If no valid solution found, undo the choice and try another
```

## Backtracking Template üíª
```python
def backtrack(candidate, remaining_choices):
    if is_solution(candidate):
        # Found a solution, process it
        process_solution(candidate)
        return
    
    for choice in get_valid_choices(candidate, remaining_choices):
        # Make a choice
        add_to_candidate(candidate, choice)
        
        # Explore further with this choice
        backtrack(candidate, remaining_choices)
        
        # Undo the choice (backtrack)
        remove_from_candidate(candidate, choice)
```

## Common Backtracking Problems üöÄ

### 1. Permutations
Finding all possible arrangements of a set of elements.

```python
def permutations(nums):
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(current, remaining):
        if not remaining:
            result.append(current[:])
            return
            
        for i in range(len(remaining)):
            # Choose
            current.append(remaining[i])
            
            # Explore
            backtrack(current, remaining[:i] + remaining[i+1:])
            
            # Unchoose
            current.pop()
    
    backtrack([], nums)
    return result

# Example: permutations([1, 2, 3])
# Output: [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```

### 2. Combinations
Finding all possible ways to select k elements from a set.

```python
def combinations(nums, k):
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, current):
        if len(current) == k:
            result.append(current[:])
            return
            
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Choose
            current.append(nums[i])
            
            # Explore
            backtrack(i + 1, current)
            
            # Unchoose
            current.pop()
    
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result

# Example: combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
# Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
```

### 3. Subsets
Finding all possible subsets of a set.

```python
def subsets(nums):
    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, current):
        # Each state of current is a valid subset
        result.append(current[:])
        
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # Choose
            current.append(nums[i])
            
            # Explore
            backtrack(i + 1, current)
            
            # Unchoose
            current.pop()
    
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result

# Example: subsets([1, 2, 3])
# Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]]
```

### 4. N-Queens Problem
Placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

```python
def solve_n_queens(n):
    result = []
    
    def is_safe(board, row, col):
        # Check column
        for i in range(row):
            if board[i] == col:
                return False
        
        # Check upper-left diagonal
        for i, j in zip(range(row-1, -1, -1), range(col-1, -1, -1)):
            if board[i] == j:
                return False
        
        # Check upper-right diagonal
        for i, j in zip(range(row-1, -1, -1), range(col+1, n)):
            if board[i] == j:
                return False
        
        return True
    
    def backtrack(row, board):
        if row == n:
            # Convert board representation to required format
            solution = ['.' * col + 'Q' + '.' * (n - col - 1) for col in board]
            result.append(solution)
            return
        
        for col in range(n):
            if is_safe(board, row, col):
                # Choose
                board[row] = col
                
                # Explore
                backtrack(row + 1, board)
                
                # Unchoose (not necessary here as we overwrite in the next iteration)
    
    # board[i] = j means queen at row i is placed at column j
    backtrack(0, [-1] * n)
    return result
```

### 5. Sudoku Solver
Filling a 9√ó9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3√ó3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

```python
def solve_sudoku(board):
    def is_valid(row, col, num):
        # Check row
        for x in range(9):
            if board[row][x] == num:
                return False
        
        # Check column
        for x in range(9):
            if board[x][col] == num:
                return False
        
        # Check 3x3 box
        start_row, start_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3)
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                if board[i + start_row][j + start_col] == num:
                    return False
        
        return True
    
    def solve():
        for i in range(9):
            for j in range(9):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    for num in '123456789':
                        if is_valid(i, j, num):
                            # Choose
                            board[i][j] = num
                            
                            # Explore
                            if solve():
                                return True
                            
                            # Unchoose
                            board[i][j] = '.'
                    
                    # No valid number found
                    return False
        
        # Entire board filled
        return True
    
    solve()
    return board
```

## Visualization üìä
Backtracking can be visualized as a tree where:
- Each node represents a partial solution
- Branches represent choices
- Leaf nodes represent complete solutions or dead ends

```
                    []
                   /  \
                 [1]   [2]
                /  \    / \
            [1,2] [1,3] [2,1] [2,3]
             /      /     \      \
         [1,2,3] [1,3,2] [2,1,3] [2,3,1]
```
*Example: Decision tree for generating permutations of [1,2,3]*

## Advantages and Disadvantages ‚öñÔ∏è
### Advantages ‚úÖ

## Common Optimization Techniques üîß
1. **Early Pruning**: Check constraints as early as possible to avoid exploring invalid paths
2. **Ordering Heuristics**: Try the most promising choices first
3. **Constraint Propagation**: Use constraints to reduce the search space

5. **Bitmasking**: Use bit manipulation for efficient state representation
