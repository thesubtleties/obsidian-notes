## Definition üìù
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current depth level before moving to vertices at the next depth level. It starts at a chosen source vertex and explores all its neighbors before moving to their neighbors.

Think of BFS as exploring a graph in "waves" that spread out from the starting point, like ripples in a pond.

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
| Aspect | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time Complexity | O(V + E) |
| Space Complexity | O(V) |

Where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.

## Core Operations üîç
- **Traversal**: Visit all vertices in a graph, level by level
- **Shortest Path**: Find shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph
- **Connected Components**: Identify connected components in an undirected graph
- **Level Order Traversal**: Visit all nodes in a tree level by level

## Implementation üíª

### Basic BFS Implementation (Python)
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    # Keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set([start])
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([start])
    
    # Result list to store traversal order
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a vertex from queue
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        result.append(vertex)
        
        # Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex
        # If an adjacent vertex has not been visited, mark it
        # visited and enqueue it
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
                
    return result
```

### BFS for Shortest Path (Python)
```python
from collections import deque

def shortest_path_bfs(graph, start, end):
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque([(start, [start])])
    
    # Set to keep track of visited nodes
    visited = set([start])
    
    while queue:
        # Dequeue a vertex and its path
        vertex, path = queue.popleft()
        
        # If we found the end vertex, return the path
        if vertex == end:
            return path
        
        # Check all neighbors
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                # Enqueue the neighbor and the path to it
                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
    
    # If we get here, there's no path
    return None
```

### BFS in Java
```java
import java.util.*;

public class BFS {
    public static List<Integer> bfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Add the start node
        visited.add(start);
        queue.add(start);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            // Remove the first vertex from queue
            int vertex = queue.poll();
            result.add(vertex);
            
            // Get all adjacent vertices
            List<Integer> neighbors = graph.getOrDefault(vertex, Collections.emptyList());
            
            for (int neighbor : neighbors) {
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Common Examples üöÄ

### Tree Level-Order Traversal
```python
from collections import deque

def level_order_traversal(root):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level.append(node.val)
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(level)
    
    return result
```

### Grid Traversal (2D Matrix)
```python
from collections import deque

def bfs_grid(grid, start_row, start_col):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = set([(start_row, start_col)])
    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col)])
    result = []
    
    # Possible movements: up, right, down, left
    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
    
    while queue:
        row, col = queue.popleft()
        result.append(grid[row][col])
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = row + dr, col + dc
            
            # Check if the new position is valid
            if (0 <= new_row < rows and 
                0 <= new_col < cols and 
                (new_row, new_col) not in visited and
                grid[new_row][new_col] != '#'):  # Assuming '#' is a wall
                
                visited.add((new_row, new_col))
                queue.append((new_row, new_col))
    
    return result
```

## Common BFS Problems and Solutions üß©

    visited = set()
    components = []
    
    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            component = []
            queue = deque([node])
            visited.add(node)
            
            while queue:

                for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append(neighbor)
            
            components.append(component)
    
    return components
```

### Problem 2: Bipartite Graph Check
```python
def is_bipartite(graph):
    # Initialize colors for each node (-1 means uncolored)
    colors = {node: -1 for node in graph}
    
    for start in graph:
        # Skip already colored nodes
        if colors[start] != -1:
            continue
        
        # Start BFS with color 0
        queue = deque([start])
        colors[start] = 0
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if colors[neighbor] == -1:
                    # Color with opposite color
                    colors[neighbor] = 1 - colors[node]
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                elif colors[neighbor] == colors[node]:
                    # Same color neighbors means not bipartite
                    return False
    
    return True
```
