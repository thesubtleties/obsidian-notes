## Definition üìù
The Two Pointers technique is a pattern where two pointers iterate through a data structure (usually an array or linked list) simultaneously until they meet a certain condition. This approach is particularly useful for solving problems with sequential data where you need to find pairs or subarrays that satisfy specific criteria.

Two pointers often help transform a problem that would typically require nested loops (O(n¬≤)) into a more efficient single-pass solution (O(n)).

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
| Approach | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Two Pointers | O(n) | O(1) |
| Naive (nested loops) | O(n¬≤) | O(1) |

The two pointers technique typically achieves linear time complexity while maintaining constant space complexity, making it highly efficient for large datasets.

## Core Operations üîç
- Initialize two pointers at specific positions
- Move pointers based on certain conditions
- Process elements at pointer positions
- Check for target conditions
- Handle edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)

## Types of Two Pointer Approaches üîÑ

### 1. Opposite Direction (Left/Right) Pointers
```
Start pointers at opposite ends (usually first and last elements)
Move towards each other until they meet or a condition is satisfied
```

### 2. Fast/Slow Pointers
```
Both pointers start at the beginning
Fast pointer moves at a faster rate than the slow pointer
Used for cycle detection, finding middle elements, etc.
```

### 3. Multiple Arrays Pointers
```
Use separate pointers for different arrays
Move pointers through respective arrays based on comparison conditions
```

### 4. Three Pointers
```
Extension of two pointers with an additional pointer
Often used in problems requiring three elements (like 3Sum)
```

## Implementation üíª

### Opposite Direction (Left/Right) Pointers Example: Two Sum Sorted

```python
def two_sum_sorted(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]  # Found the pair
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1  # Need a larger sum, move left pointer right
        else:
            right -= 1  # Need a smaller sum, move right pointer left
            
    return [-1, -1]  # No solution found
```

### Fast/Slow Pointers Example: Detect Cycle in Linked List

```python
def has_cycle(head):
    if not head or not head.next:
        return False
    
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    # Fast pointer moves twice as fast as slow pointer
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next        # Move slow pointer by 1
        fast = fast.next.next   # Move fast pointer by 2
        
        # If there's a cycle, fast will eventually catch up to slow
        if slow == fast:
            return True
            
    return False  # Fast pointer reached the end, no cycle
```

### Multiple Arrays Example: Merge Two Sorted Arrays

```python
def merge_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2):
    result = []
    p1, p2 = 0, 0
    
    while p1 < len(nums1) and p2 < len(nums2):
        if nums1[p1] <= nums2[p2]:
            result.append(nums1[p1])
            p1 += 1
        else:
            result.append(nums2[p2])
            p2 += 1
    
    # Add remaining elements
    result.extend(nums1[p1:])
    result.extend(nums2[p2:])
    
    return result
```

## Common Examples üöÄ

### 1. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
        
    # Slow pointer keeps track of the position to place next unique element
    slow = 0
    
    # Fast pointer scans through the array
    for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[fast] != nums[slow]:
            slow += 1
            nums[slow] = nums[fast]
            
    return slow + 1  # Length of the array with duplicates removed
```

### 2. Valid Palindrome
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    # Convert to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
    s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
    
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
        
    return True
```

### 3. Three Sum (Three Pointers)
```python
def three_sum(nums):
    nums.sort()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        # Skip duplicates for the first pointer
        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            continue
            
        left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
            
            if total < 0:
                left += 1
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1
            else:
                # Found a triplet
                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                
                # Skip duplicates for second and third pointers
                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                    left += 1
                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                    right -= 1
                    
                left += 1
                right -= 1
                
    return result
```

## Problem-Solving Patterns üß©

### When to Use Two Pointers:
1. **Searching pairs** in a sorted array (Two Sum)
2. **Removing duplicates** from sorted arrays
3. **Checking palindromes** or string manipulations
4. **Finding subarrays** with specific properties (sliding window)
5. **Cycle detection** in linked lists
6. **Merging** sorted arrays or linked lists
7. **Partitioning** arrays (like in QuickSort)

### Common Patterns:
- **Converging pointers**: Start from opposite ends, move towards each other
- **Parallel movement**: Both pointers move in the same direction
- **Fast/slow pointers**: One pointer moves faster than the other
- **Multiple array traversal**: Separate pointers for different arrays
