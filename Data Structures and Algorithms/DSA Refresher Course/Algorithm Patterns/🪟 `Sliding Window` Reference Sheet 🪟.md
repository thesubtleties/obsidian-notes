## Definition üìù
The Sliding Window technique is a method for solving array/string problems by maintaining a "window" of elements that slides through the data structure. It's particularly useful for finding subarrays or substrings that satisfy certain conditions, reducing the need for nested loops and improving efficiency.

Key characteristics:
- Maintains a subset of elements as a "window"
- Window expands or contracts based on problem conditions
- Typically moves from left to right through the data
- Tracks information about the current window to avoid redundant calculations

## Complexity Analysis ‚è±Ô∏è
| Implementation | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Fixed-size window | O(n) | O(1) or O(k) |
| Variable-size window | O(n) | O(1) or O(k) |

Where n is the size of the array/string and k is the window size or unique elements in the window.

The sliding window technique transforms what would typically be an O(n¬≤) brute force approach into an O(n) solution.

## Core Operations üîç
- **Initialize window**: Set up initial window (usually starting at index 0)
- **Expand window**: Add elements to the window (typically from the right)
- **Contract window**: Remove elements from the window (typically from the left)
- **Process window**: Calculate or check conditions on the current window
- **Slide window**: Move the window forward (expand right, contract left)
- **Track optimal result**: Keep track of the best result found so far

## Types of Sliding Windows üîÑ

### Fixed-Size Window
Used when the subarray/substring size is fixed (e.g., "find max sum subarray of size k").

```python
def fixed_window_example(arr, k):
    # Initialize
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    
    # Slide window
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        # Remove leftmost element, add rightmost element
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i-k] + arr[i]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```

### Variable-Size Window
Used when the window size can change based on certain conditions (e.g., "smallest subarray with sum ‚â• target").

```python
def variable_window_example(arr, target):
    window_sum = 0
    left = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for right in range(len(arr)):
        # Expand window
        window_sum += arr[right]
        
        # Contract window while condition is satisfied
        while window_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            window_sum -= arr[left]
            left += 1
    
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

## Common Examples üöÄ

### 1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    max_sum = 0
    window_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[i]
        
        if i >= k - 1:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
            window_sum -= arr[i - (k - 1)]
    
    return max_sum
```

### 2. Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters
```python
def longest_substring_with_k_distinct(s, k):
    char_frequency = {}
    max_length = 0
    window_start = 0
    
    for window_end in range(len(s)):
        right_char = s[window_end]
        char_frequency[right_char] = char_frequency.get(right_char, 0) + 1
        
        # Shrink the window if we have more than k distinct characters
        while len(char_frequency) > k:
            left_char = s[window_start]
            char_frequency[left_char] -= 1
            if char_frequency[left_char] == 0:
                del char_frequency[left_char]
            window_start += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
    
    return max_length
```

### 3. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
```python
def min_subarray_sum(arr, target):
    window_sum = 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    window_start = 0
    
    for window_end in range(len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[window_end]
        
        while window_sum >= target:
            min_length = min(min_length, window_end - window_start + 1)
            window_sum -= arr[window_start]
            window_start += 1
    
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else 0
```

## Problem-Solving Framework üß©

### When to Use Sliding Window
- Problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings
- Finding maximum/minimum/average of all subarrays of size k
- Finding longest/shortest subarray with a given condition
- Finding number of subarrays that satisfy a condition

### Step-by-Step Approach
1. Identify if the problem can use sliding window (contiguous elements)
2. Determine if it's a fixed or variable size window problem
3. Initialize window variables (start, end, sum, count, etc.)
4. Process the first window
5. Slide the window through the array/string
6. Update result as needed
7. Return the final result

## Visualization üìä

### Fixed Window (size 3)
```
Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, 8, 4, 7, 9]

Iteration 1: [1, 3, 2], 6, 8, 4, 7, 9  ‚Üí Sum = 6
Iteration 2: 1, [3, 2, 6], 8, 4, 7, 9  ‚Üí Sum = 11
Iteration 3: 1, 3, [2, 6, 8], 4, 7, 9  ‚Üí Sum = 16
Iteration 4: 1, 3, 2, [6, 8, 4], 7, 9  ‚Üí Sum = 18
Iteration 5: 1, 3, 2, 6, [8, 4, 7], 9  ‚Üí Sum = 19
Iteration 6: 1, 3, 2, 6, 8, [4, 7, 9]  ‚Üí Sum = 20

Maximum sum = 20
```

### Variable Window
```
Array: [4, 2, 1, 7, 8, 1, 2, 8, 1, 0]
Target sum: 8

Start: [4], sum = 4 < 8
Expand: [4, 2], sum = 6 < 8
Expand: [4, 2, 1], sum = 7 < 8
Expand: [4, 2, 1, 7], sum = 14 > 8
Contract: [2, 1, 7], sum = 10 > 8
Contract: [1, 7], sum = 8 == 8 (Found a valid window of size 2)
Expand: [1, 7, 8], sum = 16 > 8
Contract: [7, 8], sum = 15 > 8
Contract: [8], sum = 8 == 8 (Found another valid window of size 1)
...

Minimum window size = 1
```
