## Problem Statement
Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day, find the maximum profit you can achieve from buying and selling the stock once.

**Constraints:**
- You must buy before you sell
- You can only complete at most one transaction (buy once, sell once)
- If no profit is possible, return 0

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5
```

### Example 2
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Prices only decrease, so no profit possible
```

## Solutions

### ❌ Brute Force Approach (Incorrect Initial Attempt)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for slow in prices:
            for fast in prices:
                if fast - slow > result:
                    result = fast - slow
        return result
```

**Problems:**
- Allows "time travel" (selling before buying)
- Compares prices in wrong chronological order
- Time Complexity: O(n²)

### ✅ Brute Force Approach (Fixed)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(prices)):  # Ensure j > i
                buy_price = prices[i]
                sell_price = prices[j]
                if sell_price - buy_price > result:
                    result = sell_price - buy_price
        return result
```

**Key Fix:** `range(i + 1, len(prices))` ensures we only sell after buying

**Time Complexity:** O(n²)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

### 🎯 Optimal Solution (Single Pass)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        result = 0
        lowest = prices[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            # Check if selling today gives better profit
            if prices[i] - lowest > result:
                result = prices[i] - lowest
            
            # Update lowest price seen so far
            if prices[i] < lowest:
                lowest = prices[i]
        
        return result
```

**Time Complexity:** O(n)  
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Algorithm Walkthrough

### Trace Example: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

| Day | Price | Lowest | Current Profit | Max Profit | Action |
|-----|-------|--------|----------------|------------|---------|
| 0   | 7     | 7      | -              | 0          | Initialize |
| 1   | 1     | 1      | 1-7 = -6       | 0          | Update lowest |
| 2   | 5     | 1      | 5-1 = 4        | 4          | Update max profit |
| 3   | 3     | 1      | 3-1 = 2        | 4          | No change |
| 4   | 6     | 1      | 6-1 = 5        | 5          | Update max profit |
| 5   | 4     | 1      | 4-1 = 3        | 5          | No change |

**Result:** 5 (Buy at 1, sell at 6)

## Key Insights

### 🧠 Core Concept
At any given day, to maximize profit if selling today, you need to have bought at the **lowest price seen so far**.

### 🔑 Algorithm Logic
1. **Track minimum price** encountered as we scan left to right
2. **At each day**, calculate profit if we sold today: `current_price - min_price_so_far`
3. **Keep the maximum profit** seen across all days

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- **Time travel bug**: Comparing all pairs without ensuring chronological order
- **Off-by-one errors**: Starting loops at wrong indices
- **Edge cases**: Single day (no transaction possible)

## Alternative Implementations

### Cleaner Version
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            min_price = min(min_price, price)
            profit = price - min_price
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        
        return max_profit
```

### One-liner (Less Readable)
```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price, max_profit = float('inf'), 0
        for price in prices:
            min_price, max_profit = min(min_price, price), max(max_profit, price - min_price)
        return max_profit
```

## Edge Cases

```python
# Single day - no transaction possible
prices = [5]
# Output: 0

# Decreasing prices - no profit possible  
prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
# Output: 0

# All same prices
prices = [3,3,3,3]
# Output: 0

# Two days only
prices = [1,5]
# Output: 4
```
