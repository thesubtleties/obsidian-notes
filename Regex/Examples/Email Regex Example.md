`^[\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4}$`

1. `^` : Start of the string

2. `[\w-\.]+` : 
   - `[\w-\.]` matches any word character (letter, number, underscore), hyphen, or period.
   - `+` means "one or more of the preceding element"
   This part matches the local part of the email (before the @)

3. `@` : Literal "@" symbol

4. `([\w-]+\.)+` :
   - `[\w-]+` matches one or more word characters or hyphens
   - `\.` matches a literal period
   - The parentheses group this, and the `+` after means "one or more of this group"
   This part matches the domain name, allowing for subdomains

5. `[\w-]{2,4}` :
   - Matches 2 to 4 word characters or hyphens
   This part is for the top-level domain (like .com, .org, .co.uk)

6. `$` : End of the string

Now, let's explain how it captures different lengths and parts:

- Local part (before @): `[\w-\.]+`
  - The `+` allows for one or more characters, so it can match short names like "a@" or long names like "very.long.email.address@"
  - It allows periods, so "first.last@" is valid

- Domain part (after @): `([\w-]+\.)+`
  - The `+` outside the parentheses allows for multiple parts separated by dots
  - It can match simple domains like "example.com" or more complex ones like "sub.domain.example.co.uk"

- Top-level domain: `[\w-]{2,4}`
  - The `{2,4}` specifies a length of 2 to 4 characters
  - This covers most common TLDs like .com, .org, .net (3 chars) or .io, .co (2 chars), or .info (4 chars)

Examples of what it would match:
- simple@example.com
- very.common@example.com
- disposable.style.email.with+symbol@example.com
- other.email-with-hyphen@example.com
- fully-qualified-domain@example.com
- user.name+tag+sorting@example.com (Google uses this format)
- x@example.com (one-letter local-part)
- example-indeed@strange-example.com
- example@s.example

It's worth noting that while this regex covers many common email formats, it's not perfect. The full specification for valid email addresses is quite complex, and this regex is a simplified version that works for most practical purposes.
