## 📝 Introduction

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) represents a significant advancement in how we interact with AI models, allowing them to access external tools and data sources in a standardized way. Think of MCP as the "USB-C for AI" - a universal connector that lets AI models plug into various tools and data sources without custom integration work for each combination.

Before you can start building with MCP, you'll need to set up a proper development environment. This guide will walk you through that process step by step, from installing Python to configuring your first MCP project. By the end, you'll have a fully functional environment ready for MCP development.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic familiarity with command line interfaces
- Understanding of Python fundamentals
- A computer with internet access

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources. Similar to how REST APIs standardized web service interactions, MCP standardizes how AI models can request and use external capabilities.

### Development Environment Components

To work with MCP effectively, your development environment needs:

1. **Python**: The programming language we'll use
2. **Package Manager**: For installing and managing dependencies
3. **MCP SDK**: The Python library that implements the MCP standard
4. **Virtual Environment**: To isolate project dependencies
5. **Code Editor**: For writing and editing your code

### Why Use a Dedicated Environment?

If you're coming from web development, this is similar to setting up Node.js, npm, and project-specific packages. Just as you wouldn't want conflicting JavaScript library versions across projects, you don't want Python package conflicts either.

## 💻 Setting Up Your Environment

### Step 1: Install Python 3.10+

MCP requires Python 3.10 or newer. Let's verify your current Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

If you don't have Python installed or have an older version:

**For Windows:**
1. Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Run the installer, checking "Add Python to PATH"
3. Verify installation with `python --version`

**For macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install python@3.10

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

**For Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.10 python3.10-venv python3.10-dev

# Verify installation
python3 --version
```

### Step 2: Install the uv Package Manager

The uv package manager is a modern, fast alternative to pip that we'll use for dependency management:

```bash
# Install uv using pip
pip install uv

# Verify installation
uv --version
```

### Step 3: Create a Project Directory

Let's create a dedicated directory for your MCP project:

```bash
# Create and navigate to a new directory
mkdir mcp-project
cd mcp-project
```

### Step 4: Set Up a Virtual Environment

Virtual environments isolate project dependencies, preventing conflicts between projects:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should now see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

### Step 5: Install the MCP SDK

Now let's install the MCP Python SDK:

```bash
# Using uv to install the MCP SDK
uv pip install mcp-sdk
```

### Step 6: Verify Your Installation

Let's create a simple script to verify everything is working:

```python
# Create a file named test_mcp.py
import mcp
print(f"MCP SDK version: {mcp.__version__}")
```

Run the script:

```bash
python test_mcp.py
```

If you see the MCP SDK version printed without errors, your setup is complete!

## 🚀 Creating Your First MCP Project

Now that your environment is set up, let's create a simple project structure:

```bash
# Create project directories
mkdir -p src/tools
touch src/__init__.py
touch src/tools/__init__.py
touch main.py
touch requirements.txt
```

Add the MCP SDK to your requirements file:

```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
mcp-sdk>=0.1.0
```

Create a basic MCP application in `main.py`:

```python
import mcp
from mcp import Tool, ToolCall

# Define a simple tool
@Tool.create
def hello_world(name: str) -> str:
    """Say hello to someone.
    
    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet
        
    Returns:
        A greeting message
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to MCP development."

# Main function
def main():
    print("MCP Development Environment Test")
    print(f"Using MCP SDK version: {mcp.__version__}")
    
    # Test the tool directly
    result = hello_world("Developer")
    print(f"Tool result: {result}")
    
    # This is where you would typically integrate with an AI model
    # using the MCP protocol, which we'll cover in future lessons

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Run your first MCP application:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see output confirming your MCP SDK version and a greeting message.

## 🔍 Common Issues and Debugging

### Python Version Conflicts

**Issue**: You have multiple Python versions installed, and the wrong one is being used.

**Solution**: Use the specific Python version in commands:
```bash
python3.10 -m venv venv
```

### Virtual Environment Not Activating

**Issue**: The `activate` command doesn't seem to work.

**Solution**: 
- For Windows, ensure you're using `venv\Scripts\activate`
- For macOS/Linux, ensure you're using `source venv/bin/activate`
- Check for typos in the path

### Package Installation Failures

**Issue**: The MCP SDK fails to install.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your internet connection is stable
2. Update uv: `pip install --upgrade uv`
3. Try installing with pip instead: `pip install mcp-sdk`
4. Check for error messages about missing system dependencies

### Import Errors When Running Code

**Issue**: You get `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to import MCP.

**Solution**:
1. Ensure your virtual environment is activated
2. Verify the package is installed: `pip list | grep mcp`
3. Check for typos in import statements

## 🚀 Best Practices

### 1. Use Project-Specific Virtual Environments

Always create a separate virtual environment for each MCP project to avoid dependency conflicts.

```bash
# Create a new environment for each project
python -m venv /path/to/project/venv
```

### 2. Track Dependencies with Requirements Files

Maintain a `requirements.txt` file with all your project dependencies:

```bash
# Generate requirements file
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install from requirements file
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Use Environment Variables for Configuration

Store sensitive information and configuration in environment variables, not in your code:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Access environment variables
api_key = os.getenv("MCP_API_KEY")
```

### 4. Organize Your Tools in Modules

As your project grows, organize your MCP tools into separate modules:

```
src/
  tools/
    __init__.py
    search_tools.py
    calculation_tools.py
    data_tools.py
```

### 5. Document Your Tools Thoroughly

Use docstrings to document your tools - these will be used by AI models to understand how to use them:

```python
@Tool.create
def calculate_area(length: float, width: float) -> float:
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle.
    
    Args:
        length: The length of the rectangle in meters
        width: The width of the rectangle in meters
        
    Returns:
        The area in square meters
    """
    return length * width
```

## 🔄 Connecting to Web Development Concepts

If you're coming from web development, here are some helpful comparisons:

| Web Development Concept | MCP Equivalent |
|-------------------------|----------------|
| REST API Endpoints | MCP Tools |
| API Documentation | Tool Docstrings |
| npm/yarn | uv/pip |
| package.json | requirements.txt |
| Node.js | Python |
| Express.js Middleware | MCP Tool Wrappers |
| .env files | Same concept! |
| API Authentication | Tool Authentication |

Just as you would create RESTful endpoints that follow specific conventions, with MCP you create tools that follow the MCP protocol. The key difference is that your tools are designed to be discovered and used by AI models rather than other developers.

Now that your development environment is set up, you're ready to start building with MCP! In the next guide, we'll explore how to create more complex tools and connect them to AI models.
