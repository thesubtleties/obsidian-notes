## 📌 Overview

This guide introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and its Python SDK, providing you with the foundation to build AI-powered applications that can interact with external tools and data sources. By the end of this guide, you'll understand what MCP is, why it matters, and how to start implementing it in your Python projects.

## 📝 Introduction

### What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is like a "USB-C for AI" - a standardized way for AI models to connect with external tools, data sources, and services. Just as USB allows different devices to communicate with computers using a standard interface, MCP provides a standard way for AI models to interact with the outside world.

MCP solves a critical problem in AI development: how to give AI models access to real-time data, specialized tools, and the ability to take actions in the world while maintaining security and control. Without MCP, integrating AI with external systems often requires custom, brittle solutions for each combination of model and tool.

### Why is MCP important?

As bootcamp graduates entering the world of AI development, understanding MCP gives you several advantages:

1. **Standardization**: Build integrations once that work across multiple AI models
2. **Extensibility**: Create custom tools that AI models can use without retraining
3. **Security**: Implement controlled access to external systems
4. **Flexibility**: Connect models to databases, APIs, and specialized tools
5. **Future-proofing**: Adopt an emerging standard that's gaining industry adoption

### Real-world applications

MCP enables AI applications like:
- A customer service bot that can look up order information in your database
- A coding assistant that can run tests and commit code to repositories
- A research assistant that can search the web for current information
- A content creation tool that can access your brand assets and publish to your CMS

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### The MCP Architecture

MCP consists of three main components:

| Component | Description | Web Development Analogy |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **MCP Host** | The environment running the AI model | Like a web server hosting an application |
| **MCP Client** | The application that sends requests to the model | Like a browser or mobile app making API calls |
| **MCP Server** | Provides tools and resources the model can use | Like a third-party API service |

### Core MCP Concepts

1. **Resources**: External data sources the model can access (files, memory, etc.)
2. **Tools**: Functions the model can call to perform actions
3. **Sessions**: Conversations or interactions with the model
4. **Capabilities**: Permissions that define what a model can access

### How MCP Works

When you use MCP:

1. Your application (the MCP Client) sends a request to an AI model
2. The model runs in an MCP Host environment
3. The model can request access to tools and resources from MCP Servers
4. MCP Servers execute those requests and return results to the model
5. The model incorporates this information into its response
6. Your application receives the enhanced response

This flow allows AI models to overcome their limitations by accessing up-to-date information and performing actions they weren't explicitly trained to do.

## 💻 Implementation Example: Your First MCP Application

Let's build a simple MCP application that allows an AI model to access current weather data. This example demonstrates the basic MCP workflow.

### Step 1: Set up your environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv mcp-env
source mcp-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: mcp-env\Scripts\activate

# Install the MCP SDK and other required packages
pip install mcp-python requests python-dotenv
```

### Step 2: Create a configuration file

Create a `.env` file to store your API keys:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
```

### Step 3: Create a weather tool using MCP

Create a file named `weather_app.py`:

```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from mcp import MCP, Tool, Session

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize MCP
mcp = MCP()

# Define a weather tool
@mcp.tool
def get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = "celsius") -> dict:
    """
    Get the current weather for a location.
    
    Args:
        location: City name or location
        unit: Temperature unit (celsius or fahrenheit)
        
    Returns:
        Weather information including temperature and conditions
    """
    api_key = os.getenv("WEATHER_API_KEY")
    base_url = "https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json"
    
    params = {
        "key": api_key,
        "q": location,
        "aqi": "no"
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        
        # Extract relevant weather information
        weather_info = {
            "location": f"{data['location']['name']}, {data['location']['country']}",
            "temperature": data['current']['temp_c'] if unit == "celsius" else data['current']['temp_f'],
            "condition": data['current']['condition']['text'],
            "humidity": data['current']['humidity'],
            "wind_speed": data['current']['wind_kph'],
            "unit": unit
        }
        
        return weather_info
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}

# Create a function to interact with the AI model
def ask_about_weather(question: str) -> str:
    """
    Ask the AI about weather using our custom weather tool.
    """
    # Create a session with OpenAI
    session = Session.create(
        provider="openai",
        model="gpt-4",
        api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    )
    
    # Register our tool with the session
    session.register_tool(get_current_weather)
    
    # Send the user's question to the model
    response = session.send_message(question)
    
    return response.content

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    question = input("Ask about the weather: ")
    answer = ask_about_weather(question)
    print("\nAI Response:")
    print(answer)
```

### Step 4: Run your MCP application

```bash
python weather_app.py
```

Example interaction:
```
Ask about the weather: What's the weather like in Tokyo today?

AI Response:
I've checked the current weather in Tokyo for you. It's currently 18°C with partly cloudy conditions. The humidity is at 72% and there's a light breeze with wind speeds of 8.6 kph.

Would you like to know anything else about Tokyo's weather or perhaps check another location?
```

### How this example works:

1. We created a custom tool (`get_current_weather`) that can fetch weather data from an external API
2. We registered this tool with MCP using the `@mcp.tool` decorator
3. We created an MCP session with an AI model (GPT-4)
4. We registered our tool with the session
5. When we ask a question about weather, the AI model:
   - Recognizes it needs weather data
   - Calls our custom tool with appropriate parameters
   - Receives the weather information
   - Incorporates it into a natural language response

## 🚀 Best Practices

### Tool Design

1. **Clear documentation**: Always provide detailed docstrings for your tools
2. **Strong typing**: Use type hints to help the model understand inputs and outputs
3. **Error handling**: Gracefully handle exceptions in your tools
4. **Focused functionality**: Each tool should do one thing well

### Security Considerations

1. **API key management**: Never hardcode API keys; use environment variables
2. **Input validation**: Validate all inputs before processing
3. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Capability control**: Only give models access to the tools they need

### Performance Optimization

1. **Caching**: Cache results when appropriate to reduce API calls
2. **Asynchronous operations**: Use async for I/O-bound operations
3. **Timeout handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for external API calls

## 🔍 Common Issues and Debugging

### Typical Errors

1. **Authentication failures**: Check your API keys and environment variables
2. **Tool execution errors**: Ensure your tools handle exceptions properly
3. **Model misuse of tools**: Improve your tool documentation and examples
4. **Rate limiting**: Implement backoff strategies for API calls

### Debugging Techniques

```python
# Add logging to your tools for debugging
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@mcp.tool
def get_current_weather(location: str, unit: str = "celsius") -> dict:
    logger.info(f"Weather tool called with location: {location}, unit: {unit}")
    # Tool implementation...
    logger.info(f"Weather tool returning: {weather_info}")
    return weather_info
```

## 📚 Further Learning

### Practice Exercises

1. **Extend the weather app**: Add forecasting capability to the weather tool
2. **Create a multi-tool app**: Combine weather with another API (e.g., restaurant recommendations)
3. **Build a file tool**: Create a tool that can read and write to files
4. **Database integration**: Create a tool that queries a database
