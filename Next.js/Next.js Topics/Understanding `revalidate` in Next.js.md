The `revalidate` parameter in Next.js is not polling - it's a feature of Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) that controls how frequently a page or data should be regenerated in the background.

## What `revalidate` Does

When you set `revalidate: 60` in a fetch request or page:

1. The data is fetched and cached the first time it's requested
2. The cached version is served for subsequent requests
3. After the specified time period (60 seconds in this example), Next.js will:
   - Continue serving the cached version
   - Trigger a background regeneration of the data
   - Update the cache with the new data once the regeneration completes

## Key Points About Revalidation

- **Not Polling**: It doesn't continuously check for updates every 60 seconds
- **On-demand Regeneration**: The regeneration is triggered by a user request after the revalidation period has passed
- **No Waiting**: Users don't wait for the regeneration - they get the cached version immediately
- **Background Update**: The regeneration happens in the background without affecting user experience

## How to Use It

### In App Router (Next.js 13+)

```typescript
// In fetch requests
async function fetchAPI(endpoint: string, options = {}) {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYLOAD_URL}/api${endpoint}`, {
    ...options,
    next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  });
  
  return res.json();
}

// Or at the page level
export const revalidate = 60; // Revalidate this page every 60 seconds
```

### In Pages Router (older Next.js)

```typescript
// In getStaticProps
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchAPI('/shows');
  
  return {
    props: { data },
    revalidate: 60, // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  };
}
```

## Choosing the Right Revalidation Time

- **Low value (e.g., 10 seconds)**: For frequently updated content like stock prices
- **Medium value (e.g., 60 seconds)**: For content that updates occasionally like tour dates
- **High value (e.g., 3600 seconds/1 hour)**: For relatively static content like about pages
- **false**: Never revalidate (completely static)

## Benefits for Your DJ/Producer Site

For your site, different revalidation times make sense for different content:

- **Shows/Tour Dates**: `revalidate: 300` (5 minutes) - These change occasionally
- **Music Releases**: `revalidate: 3600` (1 hour) - New releases are infrequent
- **About Page**: `revalidate: 86400` (1 day) - This rarely changes
- **Announcements**: `revalidate: 300` (5 minutes) - These might change more frequently

This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the performance of static pages with the freshness of dynamic data.

## On-Demand Revalidation

If you want to trigger revalidation when content changes in your CMS, you can also set up on-demand revalidation using a webhook from Payload to your Next.js site.
