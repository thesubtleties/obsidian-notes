## How to Evaluate a New Framework

When exploring a new framework, consider:

1. **Community size and activity** - Check GitHub stars, issues, and PRs
2. **Documentation quality** - Is it comprehensive and up-to-date?
3. **Release frequency** - Regular updates indicate active maintenance
4. **Learning curve** - How quickly can you become productive?
5. **Performance benchmarks** - Compare with alternatives
6. **Production use cases** - Who's using it in production?
7. **Ecosystem and plugins** - Available libraries and integrations

## Practical Learning Approach

1. **Start with the official tutorial**
2. **Build a small project** - A todo app or personal dashboard
3. **Join the community** - Discord, Reddit, or forum
4. **Read the source code** - Understand how it works
5. **Contribute** - Fix a small bug or improve documentation

Remember that the best framework depends on your specific project requirements. Don't chase trends without evaluating whether they solve your particular problems.
