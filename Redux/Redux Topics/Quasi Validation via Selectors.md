## Basic Ownership Check

```javascript
export const selectIsCurrentUserOwner = (state, spotId) => {
  const currentUserId = state.session.user?.id;
  const spot = state.spots.allSpots[spotId];
  return spot?.ownerId === currentUserId;
};
```
This selector checks if the currently logged-in user is the owner of a specific spot. It compares the user's ID from the session state with the owner ID of the spot.

## User Permission Check

```javascript
export const selectUserHasPermission = (state, permission) => {
  const userPermissions = state.user.permissions || [];
  return userPermissions.includes(permission);
};
```
This selector verifies if the user has a specific permission. It checks if the given permission is included in the user's list of permissions stored in the state.

## Content Visibility Check

```javascript
export const selectIsContentVisible = (state, contentId) => {
  const content = state.content.items[contentId];
  const currentUserRole = state.user.role;
  return content?.visibleTo.includes(currentUserRole);
};
```
This selector determines if a piece of content should be visible to the current user. It checks if the user's role is included in the content's 'visibleTo' list.

## Form Field Validation

```javascript
export const selectIsFormValid = (state) => {
  const { username, email, password } = state.form;
  return username.length > 0 && email.includes('@') && password.length >= 8;
};
```
This selector performs basic form validation. It checks if the username is not empty, if the email contains an '@' symbol, and if the password is at least 8 characters long.

## Date Range Validation

```javascript
export const selectIsDateInRange = (state, date) => {
  const { startDate, endDate } = state.dateRange;
  return date >= startDate && date <= endDate;
};
```
This selector checks if a given date falls within a specified date range in the state. It's useful for validating dates in booking or scheduling features.

## Quantity Limit Check

```javascript
export const selectIsQuantityWithinLimit = (state, itemId, quantity) => {
  const item = state.inventory.items[itemId];
  return quantity <= item.stockLimit;
};
```
This selector verifies if a requested quantity for an item is within the available stock limit. It's useful for inventory management in e-commerce applications.

## Complex Authorization Check

```javascript
export const selectCanUserEditPost = (state, postId) => {
  const post = state.posts.items[postId];
  const currentUser = state.session.user;
  return currentUser.id === post.authorId || 
         currentUser.role === 'admin' ||
         (currentUser.role === 'moderator' && post.category === 'general');
};
```
This selector performs a complex authorization check. It determines if a user can edit a post based on multiple criteria: being the author, being an admin, or being a moderator for general category posts.

## Subscription Status Check

```javascript
export const selectHasActiveSubscription = (state) => {
  const { subscriptionEndDate } = state.user;
  return new Date(subscriptionEndDate) > new Date();
};
```
This selector checks if the user has an active subscription by comparing the subscription end date with the current date. It's useful for gating premium features.

## Feature Flag Check

```javascript
export const selectIsFeatureEnabled = (state, featureName) => {
  return state.featureFlags[featureName] === true;
};
```
This selector checks if a specific feature is enabled based on feature flags in the state. It's useful for gradually rolling out new features or A/B testing.

## Combined Validation Check

```javascript
export const selectCanUserPerformAction = (state, actionType, targetId) => {
  const isLoggedIn = !!state.session.user;
  const hasPermission = selectUserHasPermission(state, actionType);
  const isOwner = selectIsCurrentUserOwner(state, targetId);
  return isLoggedIn && (hasPermission || isOwner);
};
```
This selector combines multiple checks to determine if a user can perform a specific action. It verifies if the user is logged in, has the necessary permission, or is the owner of the target item.

## Usage in Components

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { selectCanUserEditPost } from './selectors';

function PostComponent({ postId }) {
  const canEdit = useSelector(state => selectCanUserEditPost(state, postId));

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Post content */}
      {canEdit && <button>Edit Post</button>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
This example demonstrates how to use a selector in a React component. It uses the `useSelector` hook to determine if the user can edit a post and conditionally renders an edit button based on the result.
