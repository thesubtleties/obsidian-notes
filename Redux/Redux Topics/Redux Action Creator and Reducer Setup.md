## Key Concepts

1. Action Creators
   - Functions that return action objects
   - Define the type and payload of actions
   - Used to dispatch actions to the store

2. Actions
   - Plain JavaScript objects
   - Must have a 'type' property
   - Can include additional data (payload)

3. Reducers
   - Pure functions that specify how state changes
   - Take current state and an action as arguments
   - Return a new state based on the action type

4. Initial State
   - Defines the starting state of the reducer
   - Often an object with multiple properties

5. Store Configuration
   - Combines multiple reducers into a single root reducer
   - Creates the Redux store with middleware and enhancers

6. Testing in Browser
   - Exposing store and actions on the window object for debugging
   - Using Redux DevTools and redux-logger for state inspection

## Key Steps

1. Create Action Types
```javascript
const LOAD_ARTICLES = 'article/loadArticles';
```

2. Create Action Creators
```javascript
export const loadArticles = () => ({
  type: LOAD_ARTICLES,
  articles: articlesData
});
```

3. Define Initial State
```javascript
const initialState = { entries: [], isLoading: true };
```

4. Create Reducer
```javascript
const articleReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case LOAD_ARTICLES:
      return { ...state, entries: [...action.articles] };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

5. Connect Reducer to Store
```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import articleReducer from './articleReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  articleState: articleReducer,
});
```

6. Setup for Browser Testing
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  window.store = store;
  window.loadArticles = loadArticles;
}
```

## Important Points

- Action types should be unique strings, often prefixed with the feature name
- Reducers should never mutate the original state
- Use the spread operator (...) to create new state objects
- Combine reducers using combineReducers for scalable state management
- Testing in the browser console can be helpful for debugging

Remember: This setup creates the foundation for managing application state in Redux, allowing for predictable state updates and easier debugging.
