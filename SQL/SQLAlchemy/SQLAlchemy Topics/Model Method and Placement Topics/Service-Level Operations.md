A service is a dedicated class that handles complex operations involving multiple models or complex business logic. Think of it as a "coordinator" that orchestrates different parts of your application.

### Why Use a Service?
Instead of putting complex logic in your models or routes, a service provides a clean place for operations that:
1. Touch multiple models
2. Require complex validation
3. Need transaction management
4. Don't naturally belong to any single model

### Example Without Service (Messy Route):
```python
@app.route('/api/sessions/<int:session_id>/speakers', methods=['POST'])
def add_speaker_to_session(session_id):
    session = Session.query.get_or_404(session_id)
    user = User.query.get_or_404(request.json['user_id'])
    
    # Validation scattered in route
    if not user.is_available(session.start_time, session.end_time):
        return {"error": "Conflict"}, 400
        
    if session.is_at_speaker_capacity():
        return {"error": "Full"}, 400
        
    # Complex logic in route
    event = session.event
    if not user.get_event_role(event.id):
        event_user = EventUser(
            event_id=event.id,
            user_id=user.id,
            role=EventUserRole.SPEAKER
        )
        db.session.add(event_user)
        
    session_speaker = SessionSpeaker(
        session_id=session.id,
        user_id=user.id
    )
    db.session.add(session_speaker)
    db.session.commit()
```

### Example With Service (Clean and Organized):
```python
# services/registration_service.py
class RegistrationService:
    """
    Handles all registration-related operations across the application.
    Use this service when dealing with any speaker or attendee registration logic.
    """
    def register_speaker_for_session(self, user, session):
        """
        Register a speaker for a session with all necessary validation
        and role assignments.
        
        Args:
            user: The User model instance to register as speaker
            session: The Session model instance they'll speak at
            
        Raises:
            ConflictError: If speaker has schedule conflict
            CapacityError: If session is full
            ValidationError: If any validation fails
        """
        # Centralized validation
        self._validate_speaker_registration(user, session)
        
        # Transaction to ensure all or nothing
        with db.session.begin_nested():
            # Ensure proper event role
            self._ensure_speaker_event_role(user, session.event)
            # Add to session
            self._add_speaker_to_session(user, session)
            
    def _validate_speaker_registration(self, user, session):
        """Private method for validation logic"""
        if not user.is_available(session.start_time, session.end_time):
            raise ConflictError("Speaker has schedule conflict")
            
        if session.is_at_speaker_capacity():
            raise CapacityError("Session full")
```

### Clean Route Using Service:
```python
@app.route('/api/sessions/<int:session_id>/speakers', methods=['POST'])
def add_speaker_to_session(session_id):
    session = Session.query.get_or_404(session_id)
    user = User.query.get_or_404(request.json['user_id'])
    
    try:
        registration_service.register_speaker_for_session(user, session)
        return {"message": "Speaker added"}, 201
    except (ConflictError, CapacityError) as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}, 400
```

### When to Use Services:
1. **Complex Business Logic**
   - Registration processes
   - Payment handling
   - Email notifications
   - Multi-step workflows

2. **Multiple Model Interactions**
   - User registers for event (affects User, Event, EventUser models)
   - Session scheduling (affects Session, Speaker, Room models)
   - Organization transfers (affects multiple users and roles)

3. **External Service Integration**
   - Payment processing
   - Email sending
   - File uploads
   - Third-party API interactions

### Benefits of Services:
1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Models stay focused on data structure
   - Routes stay focused on HTTP handling
   - Services handle complex business logic

2. **Reusability**
   - Same service can be used by different routes
   - Logic can be shared between web and API endpoints
   - Easier to test complex operations

3. **Maintainability**
   - Complex logic is centralized
   - Easier to modify business rules
   - Clear place for transaction management

4. **Testing**
   - Services are easy to unit test
   - Can mock external dependencies
   - Don't need to test through HTTP layer
