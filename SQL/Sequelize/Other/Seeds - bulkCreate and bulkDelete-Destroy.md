Excellent question. Let's tackle this inconsistency both ways: using model methods for both operations, and using queryInterface methods for both. Here's how you'd approach it:

1. Using model methods (Person) for both:

```javascript
const { Person } = require('../db/models');

module.exports = {
  async up (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await Person.bulkCreate([
      {
        name: 'John Doe',
        isBetaMember: false
      }
    ], { validate: true });
  },

  async down (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await Person.destroy({
      where: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        isBetaMember: false
      }
    });
  }
};
```

2. Using queryInterface methods for both:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  async up (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await queryInterface.bulkInsert('People', [
      {
        name: 'John Doe',
        isBetaMember: false,
        createdAt: new Date(),
        updatedAt: new Date()
      }
    ]);
  },

  async down (queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await queryInterface.bulkDelete('People', {
      name: 'John Doe',
      isBetaMember: false
    });
  }
};
```

A few things to note here:

1. When using the queryInterface approach, you need to manually specify the table name ('People'). Make sure this matches your actual table name.

2. With queryInterface.bulkInsert, you need to provide createdAt and updatedAt fields if your model uses timestamps. The model method (Person.bulkCreate) would handle this automatically.

3. The queryInterface methods work directly with the database, bypassing any hooks or validations defined in your Sequelize models. This can be faster but less safe if you rely on those hooks.

4. The model methods (Person.bulkCreate and Person.destroy) will trigger any hooks and validations you've set up, which can be safer but potentially slower for large datasets.

Choose the approach that best fits your needs. If you're dealing with raw data and speed is crucial, queryInterface might be better. If you need to ensure data integrity through model validations and hooks, stick with the model methods.

Remember, whichever method you choose, always test your migrations thoroughly, especially the down migrations. You don't want to be caught off guard when you need to rollback changes in a production environment.

Absolutely, my keen-eyed apprentice. The `destroy()` method in Sequelize can indeed perform bulk deletions. It's a powerful tool, but like any powerful tool, you need to handle it with care. Here's the lowdown:

1. Bulk Capability:
   `destroy()` can delete multiple records in one go when you provide a `where` clause that matches multiple records.

2. Usage:
   ```javascript
   await Person.destroy({
     where: {
       // conditions here
     }
   });
   ```

3. Returning Deleted Count:
   By default, `destroy()` returns the number of deleted rows.

4. Bulk Delete with Limit:
   You can even limit the number of records to delete:
   ```javascript
   await Person.destroy({
     where: { /* conditions */ },
     limit: 5
   });
   ```

5. Truncate:
   For wiping out all records (dangerous!), you can use:
   ```javascript
   await Person.destroy({
     truncate: true
   });
   ```

Now, here's where you need to watch your step:

1. Performance: For very large datasets, `bulkDelete` might be faster as it translates more directly to SQL.

2. Hooks: Unlike `bulkDelete`, `destroy()` will trigger `beforeDestroy` and `afterDestroy` hooks for each deleted record. This can be good for maintaining data integrity but bad for performance with large datasets.

3. Cascading: If you have associations set up with `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`, `destroy()` will respect these, potentially deleting associated records. `bulkDelete` won't.

4. Paranoid Models: If your model is paranoid (soft deletes), `destroy()` will perform a soft delete by default. You'd need to pass `{ force: true }` for a hard delete.

Here's how you might use it in your migration:

```javascript
const { Person } = require('../db/models');

module.exports = {
  async up(queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await Person.bulkCreate([
      {
        name: 'John Doe',
        isBetaMember: false
      }
    ], { validate: true });
  },

  async down(queryInterface, Sequelize) {
    await Person.destroy({
      where: {
        name: 'John Doe',
        isBetaMember: false
      }
    });
  }
};
```

This approach is consistent, using model methods for both `up` and `down` operations. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Always double-check your `where` clause to ensure you're not accidentally deleting more than you intend to. In a production environment, you might want to add a safety check or a limit to prevent catastrophic deletions.
