## Deleting Data in Migrations and Seeders

### Using Model.destroy

```javascript
const { User } = require('../models');

module.exports = {
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await User.destroy({
      where: {
        username: ['john_doe', 'jane_doe']
      }
    });
  }
};
```

### Using queryInterface.bulkDelete

```javascript
module.exports = {
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    await queryInterface.bulkDelete('Users', {
      username: ['john_doe', 'jane_doe']
    });
  }
};
```

### Key Differences

1. **Model Interaction**: 
   - `Model.destroy` works with Sequelize models and triggers hooks.
   - `queryInterface.bulkDelete` operates directly on the database table.

2. **Hooks and Validations**:
   - `Model.destroy` triggers `beforeDestroy` and `afterDestroy` hooks.
   - `queryInterface.bulkDelete` bypasses all model hooks.

3. **Associations**:
   - `Model.destroy` respects association cascades if set up in the model.
   - `queryInterface.bulkDelete` doesn't handle associations automatically.

4. **Paranoid Models**:
   - `Model.destroy` performs soft deletes on paranoid models by default.
   - `queryInterface.bulkDelete` always performs hard deletes.

### When to Use Each

- Use `Model.destroy` when:
  - You need to trigger model hooks
  - You want to respect model associations and cascades
  - You're working with paranoid models (soft deletes)

- Use `queryInterface.bulkDelete` when:
  - Performance is a priority for large datasets
  - You want to bypass model logic
  - You need to perform hard deletes on paranoid models

### Best Practices

1. Always test your down migrations thoroughly.
2. Be cautious with delete operations, especially in production environments.
3. Consider using a `where` clause to limit the scope of deletions.
4. For `Model.destroy`, you can use `{ force: true }` to perform hard deletes on paranoid models.
5. Use transactions for complex delete operations to ensure data integrity.

Example with transaction:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  down: async (queryInterface, Sequelize) => {
    const transaction = await queryInterface.sequelize.transaction();
    try {
      await User.destroy({
        where: { username: ['john_doe', 'jane_doe'] },
        transaction
      });
      await transaction.commit();
    } catch (error) {
      await transaction.rollback();
      throw error;
    }
  }
};
```
