Certainly! Here's a SQL "cheat sheet" for the typical ordering of clauses in a SELECT statement:

```
SELECT
FROM
JOIN
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
LIMIT
```

Detailed breakdown:

1. SELECT
   - Specifies which columns to retrieve
   - Can include calculated fields and aggregations

2. FROM
   - Indicates the main table(s) to query from

3. JOIN
   - Combines rows from two or more tables
   - Types: INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN

4. WHERE
   - Filters rows before any groupings
   - Applied to individual rows

5. GROUP BY
   - Groups rows that have the same values
   - Used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG)

6. HAVING
   - Filters groups
   - Applied after GROUP BY
   - Can use aggregate functions

7. ORDER BY
   - Sorts the result set
   - ASC (default) or DESC

8. LIMIT (or TOP in some databases)
   - Restricts the number of rows returned

Additional notes:

- Subqueries can be used in various clauses (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, etc.)
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions) go before the main query, starting with WITH
- UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT go between different SELECT statements

Remember:
- Not all clauses are required in every query
- The database processes these clauses in this order, regardless of how you write them
- Understanding this order helps in writing and optimizing queries

This order forms the logical sequence of how data is processed in a SQL query, from selecting data sources to filtering, grouping, and finally presenting the results.
