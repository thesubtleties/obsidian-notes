This guide explores composition and aggregation - two powerful object relationship patterns in Python that enable you to build flexible, maintainable code. You'll learn how objects can contain or reference other objects, how these relationships differ from inheritance, and how to implement them effectively in your Python programs.

## 📝 Introduction

When building software with object-oriented programming (OOP), understanding how objects relate to each other is crucial. While inheritance ("is-a" relationships) gets a lot of attention, composition and aggregation ("has-a" relationships) are often more practical and flexible ways to structure your code.

Think of it this way: inheritance creates a parent-child relationship between classes, while composition and aggregation create container-component relationships. These patterns allow you to build complex objects by combining simpler ones - just like building with LEGO blocks rather than creating everything from scratch.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### Composition vs. Aggregation

Both composition and aggregation represent "has-a" relationships, but they differ in one important way:

**Composition**: A strong "has-a" relationship where:
- The component cannot exist independently of the container
- When the container is destroyed, the component is also destroyed
- The component is an integral part of the container

**Aggregation**: A weaker "has-a" relationship where:
- The component can exist independently of the container
- When the container is destroyed, the component can continue to exist
- The component is associated with the container but not dependent on it

### Visual Representation

```
COMPOSITION:
┌───────────────────┐
│     Container     │
│  ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │  Component  │  │
│  └─────────────┘  │
└───────────────────┘
Component lifecycle tied to Container

AGGREGATION:
┌───────────────────┐
│     Container     │
│                   │
│    references     │
│        ↓          │
└───────────────────┘
        │
        │
┌───────────────────┐
│     Component     │
│                   │
└───────────────────┘
Component exists independently
```

### "Has-a" vs. "Is-a" Relationships

- **"Has-a"** (Composition/Aggregation): An object contains or references other objects
- **"Is-a"** (Inheritance): A class is a specialized type of another class

### Composition Over Inheritance Principle

This principle suggests favoring composition over inheritance because:
- It creates more flexible designs
- It avoids the fragile base class problem
- It prevents deep inheritance hierarchies
- It enables behavior changes at runtime

## 💻 Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Composition (Strong "Has-a" Relationship)

In this example, a `Car` class contains `Engine` and `Battery` components that cannot exist meaningfully outside the car:

```python
class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower):
        self.horsepower = horsepower
        
    def start(self):
        return "Engine started"
    
    def accelerate(self):
        return f"Accelerating with {self.horsepower} horsepower"


class Battery:
    def __init__(self, voltage):
        self.voltage = voltage
        
    def provide_power(self):
        return f"Providing {self.voltage}V of power"


class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        # Components are created inside the container
        self.engine = Engine(horsepower=150)
        self.battery = Battery(voltage=12)
        
    def start(self):
        battery_status = self.battery.provide_power()
        engine_status = self.engine.start()
        return f"{battery_status} → {engine_status}"
    
    def drive(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}: {self.engine.accelerate()}"


# Usage
my_car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(my_car.start())  # Output: Providing 12V of power → Engine started
print(my_car.drive())  # Output: Toyota Corolla: Accelerating with 150 horsepower
```

In this composition example:
- The `Engine` and `Battery` are created within the `Car`
- They have no independent existence outside the `Car`
- If the `Car` object is deleted, the `Engine` and `Battery` are also deleted

### Example 2: Aggregation (Weak "Has-a" Relationship)

In this example, a `Library` aggregates `Book` objects that can exist independently:

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        
    def get_info(self):
        return f"'{self.title}' by {self.author}"


class Library:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.books = []
        
    def add_book(self, book):
        self.books.append(book)
        return f"Added {book.get_info()} to {self.name}"
    
    def remove_book(self, book):
        if book in self.books:
            self.books.remove(book)
            return f"Removed {book.get_info()} from {self.name}"
        return f"{book.get_info()} not found in {self.name}"
    
    def list_books(self):
        if not self.books:
            return f"{self.name} has no books"
        
        book_list = "\n- ".join([book.get_info() for book in self.books])
        return f"{self.name} contains:\n- {book_list}"


# Usage
book1 = Book("Python Crash Course", "Eric Matthes")
book2 = Book("Fluent Python", "Luciano Ramalho")

city_library = Library("City Library")
campus_library = Library("Campus Library")

# Books can be added to multiple libraries
print(city_library.add_book(book1))
print(campus_library.add_book(book1))
print(campus_library.add_book(book2))

print(city_library.list_books())
print(campus_library.list_books())

# Books continue to exist even if removed from a library
print(city_library.remove_book(book1))
print(book1.get_info())  # Book still exists
```

In this aggregation example:
- `Book` objects are created independently of any `Library`
- The same `Book` can be part of multiple `Library` objects
- If a `Library` is deleted, the `Book` objects continue to exist

### Example 3: Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is a technique that makes composition more flexible:

```python
class AudioPlayer:
    def play(self, format_type):
        return f"Playing {format_type} audio"


class VideoPlayer:
    def play(self, format_type):
        return f"Playing {format_type} video"


class MediaManager:
    def __init__(self, player):
        # The player is injected rather than created internally
        self.player = player
    
    def play_media(self, format_type):
        return self.player.play(format_type)


# Usage
audio_player = AudioPlayer()
video_player = VideoPlayer()

# We can inject different players to change behavior
audio_manager = MediaManager(audio_player)
video_manager = MediaManager(video_player)

print(audio_manager.play_media("MP3"))  # Output: Playing MP3 audio
print(video_manager.play_media("MP4"))  # Output: Playing MP4 video

# We can even swap dependencies at runtime
audio_manager.player = video_player
print(audio_manager.play_media("MOV"))  # Output: Playing MOV video
```

This approach:
- Makes code more flexible and testable
- Allows changing behavior at runtime
- Follows the Dependency Inversion Principle (depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations)

## 🚀 Best Practices

1. **Choose the right relationship**:
   - Use composition when components don't make sense on their own
   - Use aggregation when components can exist independently

2. **Consider lifecycle management**:
   - In composition, the container should handle creating and destroying components
   - In aggregation, be careful about maintaining references to objects that might be deleted

3. **Apply "Composition Over Inheritance"**:
   - Ask "does this class need to BE the other class, or just HAVE the other class?"
   - Use inheritance only when there's a true "is-a" relationship

4. **Use dependency injection**:
   - Pass dependencies to objects rather than creating them internally
   - This makes your code more flexible and testable

5. **Keep interfaces clean**:
   - Don't expose component methods directly unless necessary
   - Create wrapper methods that provide a clean, unified interface

## 🔍 Common Issues and Debugging

### Circular Dependencies

**Problem**: Class A contains Class B, which contains Class A

**Solution**:
- Restructure your classes to avoid circular references
- Use dependency injection
- Consider if one class should only hold a reference to the other's ID

```python
# Problematic circular dependency
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []  # Will contain Employee objects

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, department):
        self.name = name
        self.department = department  # References a Department object
        department.employees.append(self)  # Circular reference

# Better approach
class Department:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.employees = []
    
    def add_employee(self, employee):
        self.employees.append(employee)

class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, department_name):
        self.name = name
        self.department_name = department_name  # Just store the name
```

### Memory Leaks

**Problem**: Objects not being garbage collected due to lingering references

**Solution**:
- Use weak references when appropriate
- Explicitly remove references when they're no longer needed
- Be careful with event listeners and callbacks

### Overusing Composition

**Problem**: Creating overly complex object hierarchies

**Solution**:
- Keep your design simple
- Don't create components unless they provide clear benefits
- Consider if a simple attribute would work instead of a full component class

### Practice Exercises

1. **Basic Composition**: Create a `Computer` class that is composed of `CPU`, `Memory`, and `Storage` components.

2. **Aggregation Practice**: Implement a `Playlist` class that aggregates `Song` objects. Make sure songs can be in multiple playlists.

3. **Composition vs. Inheritance**: Refactor a class hierarchy that uses inheritance to use composition instead. For example, convert a `Vehicle` -> `Car` -> `SportsCar` hierarchy to use composition.

4. **Dependency Injection**: Create a `NotificationSystem` that can work with different `NotificationChannel` implementations (email, SMS, push notification).

5. **Real-world Application**: Design a simple e-commerce system with `ShoppingCart`, `Product`, `User`, and `Order` classes using appropriate composition and aggregation relationships.
