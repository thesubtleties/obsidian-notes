## Overview

Magic methods (also known as dunder methods for their double underscore syntax) are special methods in Python that enable you to define how objects of your custom classes behave in various contexts. They allow your objects to work seamlessly with Python's built-in functions and operators, making your code more intuitive and Pythonic. This guide will introduce you to the most important magic methods, demonstrate their practical applications, and help you understand when and how to implement them in your own classes.

# 📝 Introduction

When you're working with Python's built-in types like lists, strings, or dictionaries, you can perform operations like addition (`+`), comparison (`==`), or accessing elements with square brackets (`[]`). Behind the scenes, these operations are powered by magic methods. By implementing these methods in your own classes, you can make your objects behave like Python's native types.

Magic methods are easily identified by their double underscore prefix and suffix (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`). This naming convention is why they're often called "dunder" methods (double underscore). They're automatically called by Python in response to specific operations or functions.

# 🧠 Key Concepts

## What Are Magic Methods?

Magic methods are special methods that Python calls automatically in response to certain operations:

- They always start and end with double underscores (`__method_name__`)
- They're invoked implicitly when you use certain syntax or functions
- They allow custom classes to emulate behavior of built-in types
- They make your code more intuitive and Pythonic

## Categories of Magic Methods

Magic methods can be grouped into several categories:

1. **Object Initialization and Destruction**: `__init__`, `__new__`, `__del__`
2. **Object Representation**: `__str__`, `__repr__`
3. **Attribute Access**: `__getattr__`, `__setattr__`, `__delattr__`
4. **Operator Overloading**: `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__eq__`, etc.
5. **Container Emulation**: `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, etc.
6. **Context Management**: `__enter__`, `__exit__`
7. **Callable Objects**: `__call__`

# 💻 Implementation Examples

## Object Initialization and Representation

```python
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        """Initialize a new Book object.
        
        This magic method is called when you create a new instance:
        my_book = Book("Title", "Author", 200)
        """
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages
        self.current_page = 0
    
    def __str__(self):
        """Return a string representation for end users.
        
        This is called when you use str(book) or print(book).
        """
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}, {self.pages} pages"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        """Return a string representation for developers.
        
        This is called when you view the object in a REPL or with repr().
        It should ideally be something that could recreate the object.
        """
        return f"Book(title='{self.title}', author='{self.author}', pages={self.pages})"
    
    def __del__(self):
        """Called when the object is about to be destroyed.
        
        Note: Don't rely on this for critical cleanup as it's not guaranteed to run.
        """
        print(f"Book '{self.title}' is being deleted from memory")

# Usage
my_book = Book("Python Mastery", "Jane Coder", 350)
print(my_book)  # Calls __str__
print(repr(my_book))  # Calls __repr__

# Output:
# Python Mastery by Jane Coder, 350 pages
# Book(title='Python Mastery', author='Jane Coder', pages=350)
```

## Operator Overloading

```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __add__(self, other):
        """Define vector addition with the + operator."""
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
        return NotImplemented
    
    def __sub__(self, other):
        """Define vector subtraction with the - operator."""
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return Vector(self.x - other.x, self.y - other.y)
        return NotImplemented
    
    def __mul__(self, scalar):
        """Define scalar multiplication with the * operator."""
        if isinstance(scalar, (int, float)):
            return Vector(self.x * scalar, self.y * scalar)
        return NotImplemented
    
    def __eq__(self, other):
        """Define equality comparison with the == operator."""
        if isinstance(other, Vector):
            return self.x == other.x and self.y == other.y
        return NotImplemented
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Usage
v1 = Vector(3, 4)
v2 = Vector(1, 2)

v3 = v1 + v2
print(v3)  # Vector(4, 6)

v4 = v1 - v2
print(v4)  # Vector(2, 2)

v5 = v1 * 2
print(v5)  # Vector(6, 8)

print(v1 == Vector(3, 4))  # True
print(v1 == v2)  # False
```

## Container Emulation

```python
class Playlist:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.songs = []
    
    def add_song(self, song):
        self.songs.append(song)
    
    def __len__(self):
        """Return the number of songs in the playlist.
        
        This allows using len(playlist).
        """
        return len(self.songs)
    
    def __getitem__(self, index):
        """Allow accessing songs with square brackets.
        
        This enables playlist[0], playlist[1:3], etc.
        """
        return self.songs[index]
    
    def __setitem__(self, index, song):
        """Allow setting songs with square brackets.
        
        This enables playlist[0] = "New Song".
        """
        self.songs[index] = song
    
    def __iter__(self):
        """Make the playlist iterable.
        
        This enables for song in playlist: ...
        """
        return iter(self.songs)
    
    def __contains__(self, song):
        """Check if a song is in the playlist.
        
        This enables 'song in playlist' syntax.
        """
        return song in self.songs

# Usage
my_playlist = Playlist("Road Trip Mix")
my_playlist.add_song("Highway to Hell")
my_playlist.add_song("Born to Run")
my_playlist.add_song("On the Road Again")

print(len(my_playlist))  # 3
print(my_playlist[0])    # Highway to Hell
my_playlist[1] = "Thunder Road"
print(my_playlist[1])    # Thunder Road

for song in my_playlist:
    print(f"Playing: {song}")

print("Thunder Road" in my_playlist)  # True
print("Stairway to Heaven" in my_playlist)  # False
```

## Context Manager

```python
class FileManager:
    def __init__(self, filename, mode):
        self.filename = filename
        self.mode = mode
        self.file = None
    
    def __enter__(self):
        """Called when entering a with block.
        
        This opens the file and returns the file object.
        """
        self.file = open(self.filename, self.mode)
        return self.file
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """Called when exiting a with block.
        
        This closes the file, even if an exception occurred.
        """
        if self.file:
            self.file.close()
        # Return False to propagate exceptions, True to suppress them
        return False

# Usage
# Create a test file
with open("test.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")

# Use our custom context manager
with FileManager("test.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)  # Hello, World!
# File is automatically closed when the with block exits
```

## Callable Objects

```python
class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, default=0):
        self.default = default
        self.history = []
    
    def __call__(self, x, operation='+', y=None):
        """Make the calculator object callable like a function.
        
        This allows calc(5) or calc(3, '*', 4).
        """
        if y is None:
            y = self.default
        
        result = None
        if operation == '+':
            result = x + y
        elif operation == '-':
            result = x - y
        elif operation == '*':
            result = x * y
        elif operation == '/':
            if y == 0:
                raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
            result = x / y
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown operation: {operation}")
        
        self.history.append(f"{x} {operation} {y} = {result}")
        return result
    
    def show_history(self):
        for calculation in self.history:
            print(calculation)

# Usage
calc = Calculator(10)
print(calc(5))          # 15 (5 + 10)
print(calc(7, '*', 3))  # 21 (7 * 3)
print(calc(8, '-'))     # -2 (8 - 10)

calc.show_history()
# 5 + 10 = 15
# 7 * 3 = 21
# 8 - 10 = -2
```

# 🚀 Best Practices

## When to Use Magic Methods

1. **Use magic methods to make your code more intuitive and Pythonic**
   - Implement `__str__` and `__repr__` for all your classes
   - Use operator overloading when it makes semantic sense (e.g., adding two vectors)

2. **Don't reinvent the wheel**
   - If your class is similar to a list, consider inheriting from `collections.UserList`
   - For dictionary-like behavior, consider `collections.UserDict`

3. **Be consistent with Python's built-in types**
   - If you implement `__eq__`, consider implementing `__ne__` as well
   - If you implement `__lt__`, consider implementing other comparison methods

4. **Return `NotImplemented` (not `NotImplementedError`) when an operation isn't supported**
   - This allows Python to try the reflected operation or fall back to default behavior

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Infinite recursion in attribute access methods**
   ```python
   # BAD: This will cause infinite recursion
   def __getattr__(self, name):
       return self.name  # This calls __getattr__ again!
   
   # GOOD: Access the underlying __dict__ directly
   def __getattr__(self, name):
       return self.__dict__.get(name, None)
   ```

2. **Forgetting to return a value from operator methods**
   ```python
   # BAD: No return value
   def __add__(self, other):
       self.value += other.value
   
   # GOOD: Return a new instance
   def __add__(self, other):
       return self.__class__(self.value + other.value)
   ```

3. **Modifying self in operator methods instead of returning a new object**
   ```python
   # BAD: Modifies the original object
   def __add__(self, other):
       self.value += other.value
       return self
   
   # GOOD: Returns a new object, preserving the original
   def __add__(self, other):
       return self.__class__(self.value + other.value)
   ```

4. **Using `__del__` for critical cleanup**
   - The `__del__` method is not guaranteed to be called
   - Use context managers (`__enter__` and `__exit__`) or explicit cleanup methods instead

# 🔍 Common Issues and Debugging

## Issue: Magic Method Not Being Called

**Problem**: You've implemented a magic method, but it doesn't seem to be called.

**Solution**:
- Check the method name for typos (e.g., `__ad__` instead of `__add__`)
- Ensure you're using the correct method for the operation
- Verify that the types of operands are what you expect

## Issue: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s)

**Problem**: You get an error like `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'MyClass' and 'MyClass'`

**Solution**:
- Implement the appropriate magic method (`__add__` for `+`)
- Make sure your method returns a valid value, not `None`
- Consider implementing the reflected method (`__radd__`) for right-side operations

## Issue: Unexpected Behavior with Equality Comparison

**Problem**: Objects that should be equal aren't, or vice versa.

**Solution**:
- Ensure your `__eq__` method checks all relevant attributes
- Remember that `__eq__` should return a boolean
- If you implement `__eq__`, also implement `__hash__` for consistent behavior with dictionaries and sets

## Issue: Container Methods Not Working as Expected

**Problem**: Indexing or iteration doesn't work as expected.

**Solution**:
- For indexing, ensure `__getitem__` handles both integer indices and slices
- For iteration, implement `__iter__` or ensure `__getitem__` works with sequential indices
- For `in` operator, implement `__contains__` or rely on iteration

## Debugging Tips

1. **Use `dir()` to inspect available magic methods**
   ```python
   print(dir(my_object))  # Shows all attributes, including magic methods
   ```

2. **Check if a magic method exists and is callable**
   ```python
   if hasattr(my_object, '__add__') and callable(my_object.__add__):
       print("__add__ is implemented")
   ```

3. **Use `help()` to see method documentation**
   ```python
   help(my_object.__add__)  # Shows docstring if available
   ```

- Allows conversion to Fahrenheit with `__float__`
- Implements comparison operators (`__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc.)
- Supports addition and subtraction of temperatures

### Exercise 2: Implement a Custom List
Create a `UniqueList` class that:
- Behaves like a regular list but automatically removes duplicates
- Implements `__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `__len__`, `__contains__`
- Provides a custom `__add__` method that maintains uniqueness

### Exercise 3: Build a Context Manager
Create a `Timer` context manager that:
- Records the time spent in a block of code
- Implements `__enter__` and `__exit__`
- Prints the elapsed time when the block exits
